We have an Excel sheet called "blockchain_data.xlsx" which contains information about 941 abstracts attached. 
The column of interest is "AB", which stands for abstracts.
Columns "DE" (contains keywords) and "TI" (title of the paper) can be useful as well. 

Below are the tasks we will be performing over this data:

a) Preprocess data to remove stopwords, punctuations, digits, normalize the data, lemmatize, and get rid of other noisy and meaningless words.

b) Generate a word cloud.

c) Generate 25 topics using LDA and NMF.

d) Plot the 100 most frequently occurring terms in the corpus.
